## 🚀 **TOP 5 STRATEGIC MISSING FEATURES**

### **1. TIME & ATTENDANCE TRACKING** ⭐⭐⭐

**Business Impact: HIGH** | **Integration: PERFECT**

```python
# Suggested Models
class TimeEntry(models.Model):
    employee = models.ForeignKey(Employee)
    clock_in = models.DateTimeField()
    clock_out = models.DateTimeField(null=True)
    hours_worked = models.DecimalField()
    overtime_hours = models.DecimalField()

class Timesheet(models.Model):
    employee = models.ForeignKey(Employee)
    week_start = models.DateField()
    total_hours = models.DecimalField()
    status = models.CharField()  # draft, submitted, approved
```

**Why Essential:**

- Direct integration with your existing payroll system
- Feeds overtime calculations you already have
- Links with leave management for accurate deductions
- Provides data for performance reviews

---

### **2. DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT** ⭐⭐⭐

**Business Impact: HIGH** | **Complexity: MEDIUM**

```python
# Suggested Models
class EmployeeDocument(models.Model):
    employee = models.ForeignKey(Employee)
    document_type = models.CharField()  # contract, ID, certificate
    file = models.FileField()
    expiry_date = models.DateField(null=True)
    is_sensitive = models.BooleanField()

class DocumentTemplate(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField()
    template_file = models.FileField()
    variables = models.JSONField()  # for mail merge
```

**Why Needed:**

- Employee contracts and compliance documents
- Performance review documentation storage
- Integration with payroll for tax documents
- Legal compliance requirements

---

### **3. RECRUITMENT & ONBOARDING** ⭐⭐

**Business Impact: MEDIUM** | **Strategic Value: HIGH**

```python
# Suggested Models
class JobPosting(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField()
    department = models.ForeignKey(Department)
    requirements = models.TextField()
    status = models.CharField()  # active, closed, draft

class Candidate(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField()
    email = models.EmailField()
    resume = models.FileField()
    job_posting = models.ForeignKey(JobPosting)
    status = models.CharField()  # applied, interviewed, hired

class OnboardingTask(models.Model):
    new_employee = models.ForeignKey(Employee)
    task = models.CharField()
    completed = models.BooleanField()
    due_date = models.DateField()
```

**Integration Benefits:**

- Seamless flow from candidate to employee creation
- Automatic department assignment
- Links to your performance tracking for new hire goals

---

### **4. TRAINING & DEVELOPMENT** ⭐⭐

**Business Impact: MEDIUM** | **Performance Integration: PERFECT**

```python
# Suggested Models
class TrainingCourse(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField()
    description = models.TextField()
    duration_hours = models.IntegerField()
    cost = models.DecimalField()

class TrainingEnrollment(models.Model):
    employee = models.ForeignKey(Employee)
    course = models.ForeignKey(TrainingCourse)
    enrollment_date = models.DateField()
    completion_date = models.DateField(null=True)
    status = models.CharField()  # enrolled, completed, cancelled

class SkillMatrix(models.Model):
    employee = models.ForeignKey(Employee)
    skill = models.CharField()
    level = models.IntegerField(1, 5)  # 1=beginner, 5=expert
    last_updated = models.DateField()
```

**Perfect Integration:**

- Links to your performance goals system
- Training costs integrate with payroll/budget tracking
- Skills feed into performance reviews
- Development plans support career progression

---

### **5. ADVANCED REPORTING & ANALYTICS** ⭐⭐

**Business Impact: HIGH** | **Data Leverage: MAXIMUM**

```python
# Suggested Models
class HRReport(models.Model):
    report_type = models.CharField()  # turnover, performance, payroll
    parameters = models.JSONField()
    generated_by = models.ForeignKey(User)
    generated_at = models.DateTimeField()
    file = models.FileField()

class HRMetrics(models.Model):
    metric_date = models.DateField()
    total_employees = models.IntegerField()
    turnover_rate = models.DecimalField()
    average_performance_rating = models.DecimalField()
    payroll_costs = models.DecimalField()
```

**Leverages Existing Data:**

- Performance tracking → trend analysis
- Payroll data → cost analysis
- Leave data → absence patterns
- Employee data → workforce analytics
