- ✅ Server starts without errors

## 🎯 **WHAT YOU CAN NOW DO**

### **In Django Admin:**

1. **Access Admin Panel:** http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
2. **Edit Any Record:** Navigate to any model and edit a record
3. **View History:** Click the "History" button next to the model name
4. **See Changes:** View all changes with timestamps, user, and change type

### **Historical Information Tracked:**

- ✅ **What changed:** Field-by-field differences
- ✅ **When it changed:** Exact timestamp
- ✅ **Who changed it:** User who made the change
- ✅ **Change type:** Created, Updated, or Deleted
- ✅ **Previous values:** What the data was before the change

### **Programmatic Access:**

```python
# Get all history for a record
employee = Employee.objects.get(id=1)
history = employee.history.all()

# Get specific historical version
old_version = employee.history.as_of(datetime(2024, 1, 1))

# Get changes between versions
current = employee.history.first()
previous = employee.history.all()[1]
delta = current.diff_against(previous)
```
